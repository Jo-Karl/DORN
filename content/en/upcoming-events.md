We (the Dublin Open Research Network, DORN) are a peer-led network of academics in Dublin. Our aim is to promote open research practices, with a view to enhancing research integrity, and improve the quality (rigour, reproducibility, replicability) of published research. We meet informally and discuss how open research principles can be implemented effectively, to improve research transparency across different disciplines.

We (the Dublin Open Research Network, DORN) are a peer-led network of academics in Dublin. Our aim is to promote open research practices, with a view to enhancing research integrity, and improve the quality (rigour, reproducibility, replicability) of published research. We meet informally and discuss how open research principles can be implemented effectively, to improve research transparency across different disciplines.

We encourage awareness of open research ideas and training opportunities. We believe that open research is suitable for any career stage, from early-career researchers to senior academics. We encourage collaboration between colleagues across disciplines and universities regardless of their career stage.

We promote the use of open research and research integrity within the teaching curriculum as part of an agenda for supporting students' critical thinking. We want to grow studentsâ€™ awareness of the range of relevant topics and methods, and embed their understanding within the undergraduate and graduate curriculum. The use of open science covers the spectrum from reproducibility issues, data management practices and ethical issues, open data, and the impact of statistical and analytic procedures on decision making and community outcomes.
