  - name: "David McGovern"
    designation: "david.mcgovern@dcu.ie"
    image: "/images/dcu/david_mcgovern.jpg"
    description: "David is a cognitive neuroscientist and psychologist with specific interests in perceptual decision-making, perceptual learning and multisensory perception, as well as how these processes change through natural and pathological ageing. To further our understanding of these cognitive functions, David uses a combination of psychophysical and brain imaging (mainly EEG) techniques. Where possible, the resulting data are verified through simulations derived from biologically-plausible computational models."
  - name: "Johannes Karl"
    designation: "johannes.karl@dcu.ie"
    image: "/images/team/johannes_karl.jpg"
    description: "Dr. Johannes Karl is an Assistant Professor at the Dublin City University. His current work broadly focuses on the origin and expression of individual differences in personality, values, and mindfulness. He has published on cross-cultural approaches to mindfulness, cross-temporal investigations of personality in literature using text mining, and network-perspectives on individual differences. His ongoing research projects include quantitative approaches to philosophy as way of live, the use of network statistics in cross-cultural psychology, and state-trait interactions of mindfulness."
    
  - name: "Simon Dunne"
    designation: "simon.dunne@dcu.ie"
    image: "/images/team/simon_dunne.jpg"
    description: "Dr Simon Dunne is an Assistant Prof in Psychology in the School of Psychology in the Faculty of Science and Health in DCU. His primary research interests include cancer survivorship, psycho-oncology, existential issues in health and illness, the body and self in illness and wellness and stigma/discrimination of marginalised groups. He is a Principal Investigator in the Psycho-Oncology/Cancer Survivorship stream of the DCU Cancer Research Group, is part of the steering group of the Irish Psycho-Social Oncology Network (IPSON) and has been Principal Investigator or co-investigator on a number of research projects funded by the Health Research Board, Irish Research Council and Irish Cancer Society. His research draws upon quantitative, qualitative and mixed methodologies and he is particularly interested in the interface between open science and ethics in the context of processing sensitive data."

  - name: "Catherine Fassbender"
    designation: "catherine.fassbender@dcu.ie"
    image: "/images/team/catherine_fassbender.jpg"
    description: "Dr. Fassbender's research interests include understanding the neural correlates of cognitive control processes in clinical disorders, examining cognition and reward processing following long-term substance abuse, determining neural risk factors for relapse from sobriety in substance users and examining the neural and behavioural risk factors for substance abuse in adolescents.  She conducts her research using behavioural, functional neuroimaging and electrophysiological methods. Dr. Fassbenderâ€™s goal is to better understand the cognitive impairments in clinical disorders in order to inform targeted treatments. She is also interested in identifying patterns of brain and behaviour function that will inform the early identification of individuals vulnerable to substance dependence with the goal of prevention."
