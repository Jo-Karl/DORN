Reneeta recently completed her PhD candidate in cross-cultural psychology at Victoria University of Wellington. Her research interests are rituals and culture, prosocial behaviour, group dynamics and industrial-organisational psychology. Her thesis investigated how rituals affect people socially and cognitively. Specifically, Reneeta used different methodologies to examine how synchronous movements (a specific element of rituals) have positive social outcomes on social cohesion and potentially detrimental negative outcomes on creative thinking. Reneeta is also an intercultural communication trainer and has experience working with several organisations in New Zealand.
